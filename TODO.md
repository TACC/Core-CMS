# GH-101 Header Redesign

## Known Issues

1. On CMS & Docs, there is a large gap in the navigation bar.
2. On CMS, mobile navbar opens and closes very slowly.
3. The portal login link is a bit too wide.
4. The code is often difficult to follow.

## New Issues

- remove down arrow on mobile toggle
- if close is issue, allow click on bottom no link area of lsit to close menu
- remove click on portal nav toggle (for consistency with cms/search nav)
- turn off scrolling when mobile menu is open
- docs “Next” button is too high a z-index
- rollover on all, do not let dropdown be clickable to return

## Production Bug

- Docs mobile nav not working… fix may be delayed, pending WMA CEPv2 chat
