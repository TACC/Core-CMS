## Prerequisites

* [Docker]
  * Docker Engine â‰¥ v20
  * [Docker Compose]

> **Important**
> We recommend you install the Docker Desktop application. Alternatively, you may install both Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

> **Important**
> To develop a new or existing custom CMS website for a TACC client, do **not** clone this repository. Instead, read [Develop a Custom Project]. To develop on the Core CMS (upon which our other CMS are built) continute reading.

Set up a new local CMS instance.

0. [Clone this Repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
1. Enter the Repository Clone:

    ```sh
    cd Core-CMS
    ```

2. Add Core CMS Settings & Secrets:

    Create a `taccsite_cms/*.py` for every `*.example.py`, e.g.

    ```sh
    cp taccsite_cms/settings_custom.example.py taccsite_cms/settings_custom.py
    cp taccsite_cms/secrets.example.py taccsite_cms/secrets.py
    cp taccsite_cms/settings_local.example.py taccsite_cms/settings_local.py
    ```

3. Build & Start the Docker Containers:

    ```sh
    make start
    ```

    > **Note**
    > This will make the terminal window busy. To run commands after this, **either** open a new terminal window **or** run `make start ARGS="--detach"` instead.

4. Enter the CMS Docker Container:

    (This opens a command prompt within the container.)

    ```sh
    docker exec -it core_cms /bin/bash
    # This opens a command prompt within the container
    ```

5. Update the Django Application:

    (Run these commands within the container.)

    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    # To use default "Username" and skip "Email address", press Enter at both prompts.
    # At "Password" prompts, you may use an easy-to-remember password.
    python manage.py collectstatic --no-input

    ```

6. Open Django CMS:
    1. Open http://localhost:8000/.
    2. Login with the credentials you defined in step 2.
    3. Create one CMS page.\
        (With "New page" highlighted, click "Next" button.)
        - This page will automatically be your local homepage.

> **Important**
> A local machine CMS will be empty. It will **not** have content from staging **nor** production. If you need that, follow and adapt instructions to [replicate a CMS database](https://tacc-main.atlassian.net/wiki/x/GwBJAg). This requires high-level server access or somone to give you a copy of the content.

> **Note**
> A local machine CMS does **not** include **nor** integrate with an instance of [Core Portal]. To attempt to do that, follow [How to Use a Custom Docker Compose File](https://github.com/TACC/Core-CMS/wiki/How-to-Use-a-Custom-Docker-Compose-File) and [Locally Develop CMS Portal Docs](https://github.com/TACC/Core-CMS/wiki/Locally-Develop-CMS---Portal---Docs). **Help welcome.**
