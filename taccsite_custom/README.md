# TACC CMS - Custom Instance

A functional placeholder directory into which the original remaining custom instances of TACC CMS —

- [TUP UI](https://github.com/TACC/tup-ui)
- [APCD CMS](https://github.com/TACC/APCD-CMS)
- [Texascale CMS](https://github.com/TACC/Texascale-CMS)

— add unique files and functionality. This directory has special logic and support in `settings.py`.

> [!NOTE]
> This directory is a vestige of archived [Core CMS Resources](https://github.com/TACC/Core-CMS-Resources/tree/151ef91f) and we may re-evaluate whether to continue to use it.
