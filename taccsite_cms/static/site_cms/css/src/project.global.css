/* FAQ: File paths are functional, but not consistent:
        - Local files are prepended with `./imports/`.
        - Remote files are prepended with `@tacc/core-styles/src/lib/_imports/`.
        - Automatic file locators are prepended with `_imports/`.﹡

        ﹡ Files is first searched for locally, then remotely.
