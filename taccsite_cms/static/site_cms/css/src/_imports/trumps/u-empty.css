/*
Empty

Any element that must be treated as `:empty` (even if it is not).

Examples:
- `o-section.css`:
  ```
  .o-section--layout-halfway-split > :not(:empty),
  .o-section--layout-halfway-split > :not(.u-empty) {
    flex-grow: 0;
    flex-shrink: 0;
    flex-basis: 50%;
  }
  .o-section--layout-halfway-split > :empty,
  .o-section--layout-halfway-split > .u-empty { display: none; }
  ```

.u-empty {
  /* FAQ: This class should NOT have any styles on its own. It is a unique class that allows non-empty content to appear empty to TACC stylesheets that recognize it. Any TACC stylesheet selector that recognizes `:empty` elements should also recognize `u-empty` elements. */
}
