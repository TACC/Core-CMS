# TACC CMS - Stylesheets

Stylesheets are built from source code entry point files located in `./src/*`. Stylesheets are built to static asset artifact directory `./build/*`.

Add new stylesheets into these locations to be picked up by the `npm run build` task and the django `collectstatic` steps.

See [repo `README.md` at "Static Files"](/README.md#static-files).
